I am spear-heading the project to establish an early-stage venture capital fund as a part of the University of Chicago to invest in startups wtih undergraduate founders. The fund (which I've temporarily named Midway Venture Partners, or MVP) will manage money owned by the University, but will operate by and for students, with all deal sourcing and due diligence performed by undergraduate students, overseen by MBA students at Chicago Booth. Beyond the traditional capital deployment activities of a VC firm, Midway Venture Partners will also work to dramatically expand the UChicago College startup ecosystem. MVP will hold pitch competitions, provide workspaces for students working on independent projects, and even host a podcast interviewing student founders (think *How I Built This*, UChicago Edition).

This project is in partnership with groups all across campus, from the Polsky Center for Entrepeneurship and Innovation to Midway Ventures to the Computer Science Department. As of March 2019, I am finishing a concept deck for the project and preparing extensive interviews with students across campus to inform our outreach strategy. I am also establishing staff/faculty champions of the project in different divisions of the University, building a coalition for our eventual funding request from the University.
