created basic shell, using C.

**Class**: CMSC 15400 -- Introduction to Computer Systems

**Objectives**:

* To write a complete program from scratch. We only provide a small code skeleton.
* To learn about shell functionalities. You will familiarize yourself with the Linux programming environment and gain exposure to the necessary functionality in shells.
* To learn about process interaction. You will learn about how a process is started, how a parent process waits for the child to terminate, how processes communicate via pipes, and so on.
* To learn about defensive programming. In real life, users input invalid values. Your program should perform "sanity checks."
