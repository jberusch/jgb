As a senior in the International Baccalaureate program, I elected to write my capstone essay on the dramatic shifts in our nation's treatment of juvenile defendants, focusing on Massachusetts in 1990 and 1991.

**Abstract**

Justice in American society is strangely paradoxical -- crime is hot-button topic of conversation, yet prisons are almost always completely ignored. This essay was composed under the following overarching theme: consequences of this paradox and how distancing ourselves from justice and sentencing policy has allowed American society to punish certain groups, specifically the children of America, in this case. As such, the essay answers the following question: which theories, philosophies, and phenomena -- especially those related to the superpredator myth -- of the 1994 United States juvenile crime spike effected reform?

Justice is an incredibly complex topic, requiring understanding of topics ranging from economics and politics to sociology and education, and is even more complex in the juvenile system, which grapples philosophically with the role of the state in our lives in addition. For every change in crime policy, there are myriad causes and effects too many to name. Therefore, this essay focuses primarily on the causes of juvenile crime reform in the 1990s, especially as it relates to the superpredator myth (a topic which is explained in the essay). Proof of various theories, philosophies, and phenomena involve both statistics on national trends in juvenile crime and perceptions of public sentiment by criminology and sociology experts. This essay examines  the causes of juvenile code reform and also how the updated laws deviate from those preceding and how such changes relate to stated causes of reform. 

With evidence in sources ranging from scholarly reports to media reports to crime statistics, this essay finds that juvenile policy reform in the 1990s was effected by a combination of rational theories and irrational human phenomena, both of which revolve around overarching philosophies of justice. Moreover, there are many more dangerous legal consequences of such phenomena, as they are present in most any area of public policy.
